This is my project for a coursework for my programming-1 module, 
during the first semester of my first year at the University of Southampton.

It's a simulation of a battle arena fights between students and monsters. 
Both groups form teams and have the option to fight on an easy level and on a medium one.
In the end, the output contains information about how the stats of the players change during the game,
and which team has won in the end.
